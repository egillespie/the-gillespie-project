I have been slacking in my self-imposed blog duties.  I said I would try to post something every week and now it has been three weeks since my last post.  I have had my hands full, but that is just an excuse for my slackery.  I'm going to use this post as an attempt to start again at the one-post-per-week velocity at which I tried to set out.

It has also been a while since I have posted about Kira so this week she is the topic of discussion!  She is getting unbelievably big.  In fact, she was in the 99th percentile for weight at her age and 95th percentile for length.  Her next doctor visit is this Friday so we get to see how well she has been growing over the last month.  She definitely seems more sturdy when I hold her.  She can move her head around very well now and if I hold her hands she can even stand up (from sitting!) and do most of the balancing on her own.

Kira has always had a pretty good temperament, but this past week in particular she has been especially happy.  If you don't believe it, check out the last three pictures in the slideshow below.  When she's happy, Mom and Dad are happy.  I think overall we've been getting better sleep and getting a little more done in, around, and away from the house.  I can't wait to start taking her on walks to the park nearby, maybe even going on jogs with her.  Chris and I were talking about trying to do a camping trip with her later this summer or fall too so we'll see how that goes.

It's hard to believe it's been two months already.  She seems so much bigger and that smile is really starting to show a pretty cute little personality too!  Pretty soon she'll be getting control of her unruly limbs and a little further out we'll be trying to teach her baby sign language and introducing her to solid foods (which I am particularly excited about).
