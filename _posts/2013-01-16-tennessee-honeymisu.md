Recently, I have been brainstorming ways to make Tiramisu in a way that Chris could eat (she's migraine-sensitive to chocolate and doesn't much care for espresso). It didn't take me that long to come up with an idea that not only didn't solve the problem, but would also be even more terrible for her in her pregnant state. You see, my mind had wandered toward using Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey instead of the aforementioned ingredients!

I didn't really solve the original problem, but I felt like I was on to something. I had been hanging onto the idea for a while until finally, last weekend, we were shopping and we passed by the Ladyfingers. I impulsively snatched them up and decided to try this idea out.

Those of you who are interested in recreating this: beware! While this dessert is delicious, it is also quite potent. I made it Sunday and chilled it in the fridge overnight so I could share it with coworkers the next day. It was quite the way to kick off a work week!

### Ingredients

* 1 package (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 5 tablespoons Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 container (3 cups or approx. 50 tablespoons) whipped topping
* 24 Ladyfingers
* 1/2 cup Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey
* maple sugar

### Directions

1. Mix together the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla, and 5 tablespoons of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey until smooth.
2. Combine the whipped topping and cream cheese mixture.
3. Place half of the Ladyfingers in a dish just large enough to hold them in a single layer (I used a glass bread loaf dish).
4. Gently pour 1/4 cup Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey over the Ladyfingers. Â The Ladyfingers will absorb the whiskey more evenly if you pour very slowly.
5. Spoon half of the cream cheese mixture over the Ladyfingers and spread smooth.
6. Sprinkle maple sugar over the cream cheese mixture.
7. Arrange the remaining Ladyfingers over the maple sugar.
8. Gently pour 1/4 cup Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey over the Ladyfingers.
9. Spoon the remaining cream cheese mixture over the Ladyfingers and spread smooth.
10. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
11. Sprinkle maple sugar over the dish before serving.
