What happens to Erik's brain when it has been unable to rest after a trip to Japan?  It goes a little crazy and starts coming up with strange ideas like using crushed up breakfast cereals to make pie crusts.  Oh wait, that's not strange, that's delicious!  But which cereal do I start with?  And what could I fill said pie crust with?

I thought about this for a little while and decided that I would go for something colorful like Fruity Pebbles.  I wasn't sure at the time if the pie crust would look like a gross purplish (real word, I kid you not) mess or if it would actually look like a pie crust made of Fruity Pebbles but I don't let thoughts like that stop me.  The hardest decision was actually figuring out what I could put in a pie crust made of Fruity Pebbles.

Fruit pie filling and custard/pudding fillings just didn't feel right.  Don't ask me why, but at some point my stomach said "Ice cream!" and my brain, instead of saying "But you're lactose intolerant you fool!" replied with a very loud "Hell yes!"  I went to the grocery store and picked up something colorful that would look nice inside a colorful pie crust.  The ice cream I ended up choosing was birthday cake ice cream (I think it's called that because it looks a bit like confetti birthday cake).

The results were profound.  Obviously the crust had to be made first and it wasn't a purplish mess.  It actually looked like a Fruity Pebble pie crust.  The ice cream pie filling worked out perfectly too.  Until this moment in time I never knew what a pair these two foods would make.  Even if you don't make one of these pies, you should try the cereal on ice cream.  Just crumble some cereal onto your bowl of ice cream and enjoy.

Before I dive into the recipe (which is really, really easy by the way), I have to give a shout out to one of the variations I tried at a later time.  Instead of using Fruity Pebbles I used Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  I used plain vanilla ice cream filling and then drizzled caramel over the top before refreezing.  Overall I think this tasted way better than the Fruity Pebble and birthday cake ice cream combo.  Hopefully what you take from this is that you should explore some of your own ideas of which cereals and ice creams go well together.
