This funky math turns out to have major implications.  In our case, it means that the Gillespie family has recently grown by one! Chris and I are happy to announce that we are now proud parents!  Our daughter, Kira Lynn Gillespie, was born just over three weeks ago on Saturday, February 9, 2013.  She was born a very healthy 10 pounds 4 ounces and 22 inches long and both her and Chris are doing great.

It's been a few weeks now and we're adjusting fairly well to the new lifestyle. It has lots of ups and some stressful, emotional downs, but mostly ups.  There are already some amusing stories worth remembering...

The Friday before Kira was born, we played a few games of League of Legends and went to bed around 10:30.  That's about when Chris' contractions started.  They were about ten minutes apart, nothing to be concerned about, but by the time Chris woke me up they were about seven minutes apart.  Chris told me she was ready to go to the hospital.  We took our time getting ready and just when we arrived at the hospital, the contractions had increased to that magical five minutes apart.  We parked, and as soon as we got to the elevator of the parking garage, Chris' water broke!  Our timing couldn't have been better.

After triage, Chris was given an I.V. of pitocin to regulate and increase the frequency of her contractions.  This took about ten hours, and we spent some of that time considering the date on which our daughter would be born.  At the rate that Chris' contractions were progressing, we figured she would be born on the ninth.  What I really like about this being her birthday is that it is shared with the late Frank Frazetta, whose artwork I am a big fan of and whose art inspired a series of books that I am an even bigger fan of.  There's probably also some fun and jokes to be had sharing her birthday with the date of the first ICBM launch.

We were discharged from the hospital two days after Kira was born.  Since then we've fallen into this very chaotic sort of routine where we plan all of our daily activities in 2-3 hour blocks between Kira's feedings.  Sleep is very much desired now but Kira is actually a dream child.  She's definitely fussy when she's hungry, but in general she's pretty easy to care for.  The only real struggle to date is when she wants to be walked around and bounced by a person in the middle of the night.  There's no sleep to be had when that happens so we just have to suck it up and make up the sleep at the earliest opportunity.

For those who are interested, I've got some photos too.  Warning, she's totally adorable!  I think even if I weren't totally biased I would find this to be true.
