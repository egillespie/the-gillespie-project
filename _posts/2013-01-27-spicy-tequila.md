Creating liquor infusions isn't a new concept, but I read a Men's Health article about using vanilla, peanuts, and so on to give new flavor to alcohol on your shelf and thought I would try it out.  I had been craving Bloody Marias at the time so I decided to spice it up a bit and infuse tequila with jalapeños and Serrano peppers.

I went to a local liquor store and picked out a mid-shelf bottle of tequila that a) had a wide neck and b) looked cool.  Starting the infusion was easy.  Patiently waiting for it to finish was not.  I spent two weeks wondering if this infusion would work out and what it would taste like.

The result was not what I was expecting.  Instead of the tequila taking on a jalapeño taste, it instead took on the spicy aftertaste of the peppers.  There was very little alcohol aftertaste any more.  Instead, I got fiery throat destruction (the skeletons on the bottle of Espolón suddenly seemed appropriate).  This ended up working out perfectly for making Bloody Marias.  The leftovers were also amusing to serve up as shots to adventurous friends!

### Ingredients
* 1 fifth of tequila reposado
* 2 jalapeño peppers
* 2 Serrano peppers

### Directions
1. Remove approximately 1/2 cup of the tequila from the bottle to make room for the peppers.
2. Cut all of the peppers into thin, long vertical slices small enough to fit into the neck of the bottle of tequila.  Do not remove the seeds.
3. Insert the slices of pepper, seed and all, into the tequila one at a time, making sure that the peppers are fully submerged and that the tequila does not overflow from the bottle.
4. Seal the bottle and leave it alone for 2 weeks. :(
5. Use a cheese cloth and funnel to transfer the tequila to a separate container.
6. Remove the peppers, seeds, and sediment from the original bottle.  (Pro Tip: Chop them up and put them in fresh salsa!)
7. Transfer the tequila back into its original container.
